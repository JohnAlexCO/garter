### 404: Resource Not Found

The Garter repo doesn't have a file named `{{page.title}}`.
If you're not totally sure where what the URL of the resource you're looking for is,
try <a href="https://johnalexco.github.io/garter">going back to the home-page</a> and navigating to it that way.
Alternatively, you can check out the <a href="https://github.com/johnalexco/garter">GitHub repository directly</a>
to locate the file yourself.
