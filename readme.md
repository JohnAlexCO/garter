# Garter

is an in-development programming language heavily influenced by
DarkBasic, x86 Assembly, JavaScript, Python, and C
and built from the ground-up on its own tooling and compiler toolchain.

## What's Included

Out of the box, Garter provides a compiler toolchain
[(compiler)](https://github.com/JohnAlexCO/garter)
[(assembler)](https://github.com/JohnAlexCO/gasm)
[(interpreter)](https://github.com/JohnAlexCO/gyb), 
and a lightweight standard library comparable to glibc.
_Eventually_ Garter will also include additional libraries, 
a [language server](https://github.com/JohnAlexCO/gyls), 
and a [package manager](https://github.com/JohnAlexCO/gib).
Documentation will also be available over at [Modula.dev](https://modula.dev/garter)

## Installation

Garter will be available as standalone binaries for 
64-bit Windows, Linux, and MacOS. 
For major versions, I plan to also make binaries for 
[FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/) and
[ravynOS](https://ravynos.com/).

To build Garter from source, you'll need 
[gasm](https://github.com/JohnAlex.CO/gasm), 
and if you're building `gasm` from source,
you'll also need 
[gyb](https://github.com/JohnAlexCO/gyb).
From there, building Garter look something like:
```
gyb -v && gasm -v
> gyb 0.0.0
> gasm 0.0.0
gasm garter.gasm garter
> "garter" assembled as Linux ELF in 33kiB
./garter -v
> garter 0.0.0
```

## Implementation

Garter is being written entirely in 
[gasm](https://github.com/JohnAlex.CO/gasm)(_Garter Assembly_)
by the combination of hand-written code and using C helper functions.
Once `garter.gasm` is written, it will be compiled to 
executable binaries for 64-bit Windows, Linux, and MacOS,
as well a bytecode file that can be run in 
[gyb](https://github.com/JohnAlexCO/gyb).
